Fetch data from SQL Server
====

## First Steps

* [Set up an ODBC connection to the BAM SQL server and ensure you can connect to it (test using MS Access) ](https://github.com/borealbirds/tutorials/blob/master/establish-odbc-to-sql-server/README.md)
* Install RODBC package `install.packages("RODBC")`
* Known your SQL username and password

## Establish ODBC Connection
``` {r}
library(RODBC)
```

### Option 1. 
``` {r}
cn <- odbcDriverConnect(connection="Driver = {ODBC Driver 13 for SQL Server};  
                                    server = boreal.biology.ualberta.ca\boreal;
                                    trusted_connection = no; 
                                    UID = userid; 
                                    PWD = pwd;")
```


### Option 2. 
``` {r}
cn <- odbcConnect(dsn="BOREAL", uid = "userid", pwd = "pwd")
```

BOREAL = the name you provided for your connection via the ODBC configuration
![Sever details](https://github.com/borealbirds/tutorials/blob/master/establish-odbc-to-sql-server/Fig4.serverdetails.png "Server details")

userid = the user ID you use to access the SQL server
password = the password you use to access the SQL server

![Login details](https://github.com/borealbirds/tutorials/blob/master/establish-odbc-to-sql-server/Fig5.Login.png "Login details")


## Test the connection by importing a table into R

Note: these particular tables are not up to date and will probably change names
``` {r}
XY <- sqlFetch(cn, 'dbo.National_XY_V4_2015')
```
