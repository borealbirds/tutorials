# Tutorials for BAM Folks

A place to store tutorials, scripts, and documentation for steps that most BAM Team Members will need at some point.

Each tutorial below explains a particular data processing/analysis step in the [overall BAM Modelling Workflow](https://github.com/borealbirds/tutorials/blob/master/overall-bam-modelling-workflow/README.md). 

**If you have a new tutorial to share with the group, do the following:**

1. check if the tutorial exists
    * if yes: contact the person who last committed to it and then work out how to improve it
    * if no: create a new one
2. To create a tutorial, create a new folder that has lower case letters and dashes (slugified), like `new-folder` (i.e. not `New Folder`),
2. Include your tutorial within the folder, for file options follow some of the existing tutorials.
4. Once a tutorial is started, add the link below and let Nicole know so it can be added to BAM News. 

## Tutorials

### BAM Workflow
* [Overall BAM Modelling Workflow](https://github.com/borealbirds/tutorials/blob/master/overall-bam-modelling-workflow/README.md): Understanding this will give you a better sense of what other tutorials you need to review.

### Data Structure

### Data Processing

* [Testing ODBC-to-R connection](https://github.com/borealbirds/tutorials/blob/master/testing-odbc-to-r-connection/testing-odbc-to-r-connection.md)
* [Fetch data from SQL server]
* [aargh. Prep data for offset calculation](https://github.com/borealbirds/tutorials/tree/master/prep-for-offset-creation)
* [aargh. Prep other covariates for analyses]
* [Apply QPAD](https://github.com/borealbirds/tutorials/tree/master/apply-qpad/README.md)

### Data analysis

Coming soon...

## TODO

1. Establishing ODBC connection (**DONE**)
2. Fetch data from db and pre-process long format
3. Joining tables and filtering
4. Species cross tabulation
5. Calculating species offsets
6. Analyzing point count data with QPAD offsets
