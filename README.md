# Tutorials for BAM folks

Each tutorial explains a particular data processing/analysis step.
If you have a new tutorial to share with the group, do the following:

1. check if the tutorial exists, if yes: contact the person who last commited to it,
2. if not, create a new folder that has lower case letters and dashes (slugified), like `new-folder` (i.e. not `New Folder`),
3. include your tutorial within the folder, for file options follow some of the existing tutorials.
4. Once done, add the link below.
